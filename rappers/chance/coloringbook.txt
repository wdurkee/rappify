And we back
And we back, and we back, and we back, and we back, and we
And we back, and we back, na, na, na
This ain't no intro, this the entree
Hit that intro with Kanye and sound like André
Tryna turn my baby mama to my fiancée
She like music, she from Houston like Auntie Yoncé
Man my daughter couldn't have a better mother
If she ever find another, he better love her
Man I swear my life is perfect, I could merch it
If I die I'll prolly cry at my own service, igh, igh!
It was a dream, you could not mess with the Beam
This is like this many rings
You know what I mean?
This for the kids of the king of all kings
This is the holiest thing
This is the beat that played under the words
This is the sheep that ain't like what it heard
This is officially first
This is the third
I get my word from the sermon
I do not talk to the serpent
That's the holistic discernment
Daddy said I'm so determined
Told me these goofies can't hurt me
I just might make me some earl tea
I was baptized like real early
I might give satan a swirlie
Wish I could tell you it's ready
Tell you it's ready today
They don't give nothing away
You gotta fight for your way
And that don't take nothing away
Cause at the end of the day
We know, we know we got it
We know, we know we got it
We know, we know we got it
We know, we know we got it
Music
We know, we know we got it
We know, we know we got it
We know, we know we got it
We know, we know we got it
Music
Music is all we got

Oh, oh, oh, incredible
I would... incredible
Everything...
Socks on concrete, jolly rancher kids
I was talking back and now I gotta stay at grandma's crib
Bunch of tank top, nappy headed bike-stealing Chatham boys
None of my nigga's ain't had no dad
None of my nigga's ain't have no choice
JJ, Mikey, Lil Derek and them
79th street was America then
Ice cream truck and the beauty supply
Blockbuster movies and Harold's again
We still catching lightening bugs
When the plague hit the backyard
Had to come in at dark cause the big shawty's act hard
Okay now Dave grandpa grand crossing
First day, nigga's shooting
Summer school get to losing students
But the CPD getting new recruitment
Our summer don't, our summer, our summer don't get no shine no more
Our summer die, our summer time don't got no time no more
(You're my friend)
Summer friends don't stay
Summer friends don't stay around
Summer friends, summer friends
Summer friends don't stay
Summer friends don't stay, hey
Stay around
Oh I used to kill 'em with the long hair
Momma had salon doing perms out the armchair
Yeah we're working late, he treat the crib like it's a timeshare
I would mow some lawns for my ones like a lawn chair, hugh, hugh!
Now I'm the same way, over time all the time, every night, hey
Ready my blessing, now I'm ready how I wait
Never let a friendship get in my way
Never let a blog get in my way
Make the whole song do whatever I say
79, 79, 79, 79 place
79, 79, 79, 79 place
Some of my homegirls got lost in the paperwork
They was good friends but I faked the clerk
Cause if it ain't work, can't make it work
It's been a minute since I called on a friend
Fucked up and fucked all my friends
All my friends, all my...
Stick around
Summer friends, summer...
(You're my friend...)
Summer friends don't stick around
Stick around
(And some of us...)
79, 79, 79, 79, hey
79, 79, 79, 79, hey, hey, hey
(You're my friend)
79, 79, 79, 79, hey, 79
(So put your head on my shoulder)
City wide, city wide, city wide, hey
City wide, city wide, city wide, hey
City wide, city wide, city wide, hey
City wide, city wide, city wide, hey
City wide, city wide, city wide
City wide, city wide, city wide
City wide, city wide, city wide
City wide, city wide, city wide
City wide, city wide, city wide
City wide, city wide, city wide...
(I will wait around for you)
(I will wait around for you)
(So lay your head...)
May the Lord give your journey mercy
May you be successful, grant you favor
And bring you back safely, I love you
You are very special
You're special too
Everyone is special
This I know is true
When I look at you
You are very special
You're special too
Everyone is special
This I know is true
When I look at you
I'm gon' praise him, praise him till I'm gone
I'm gon' praise him, praise him till I'm gone
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
It seems like blessings keep falling in my lap
It seems like blessings keep falling in my lap
I don't make songs for free I make 'em for freedom
Don't believe in kings, believe in the kingdom
Chisel me into stone, prayer whistle me into song air
Dying laughing with Krillin saying something 'bout blonde hair
Jesus black life ain't matter, I know I talked to his daddy
Said you the man of the house now, look out for your family
He has ordered my steps, gave me a sword with a crest
And gave Donnie a trumpet in case I get shortness of breath
I'm gon' praise him, praise him till I'm gone
Don't be mad
I'm gon' praise him, praise him till I'm gone
When the praises go up
Good God
The blessings come down
The blessings come down
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
The blessings come down
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
It seems like blessings keep falling in my lap
It seems like...
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
Good God
They booked the nicest hotels on the 59th floor
With the big wide windows, with the suicide doors
Ain't no blood on my money, ain't no Twitter in heaven
I know them drugs isn't close, ain't no visit in heaven
I know the difference between blessings and worldly possessions
Like my ex girl getting pregnant and her becoming my everything
War with my wrongs, I'm writing four different songs
I never forced you to forfeit it, I'm a force to be reconciled
They want four minute songs
You need a four hour praise dance performed every morn
I'm feeling shortness of breath, so Nico grab you a horn
Hit Jericho with a buzzer beater to end a quarter
Watch brick and mortar fall like dripping water, ugh!
We don't do the same drugs no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more
Cause she don't do the same drugs no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more
When did you change?
Wendy you've aged
I thought you'd never grow up
I thought you'd never...
Window closed, Wendy got old
I was too late, I was too late
A shadow of what I once was
Cause we don't do the same drugs no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more
She don't laugh the same way no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more
Where did you go?
Why would you stay?
You must have lost your marbles
You always were so forgetful
In a hurry, don't wait up
I was too late, I was too late
A shadow of what I once was
Cause we don't, we don't do what we say we're gonna
You were always perfect, and I was only practice
Don't you miss the days, stranger?
Don't you miss the days?
Don't you miss the danger?
We don't (we don't) do the same drugs no more (do the same drugs no more)
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more
We don't (we don't) do the same drugs no more (do the same drugs no more)
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs...
(Turn it around
I remember when
This age of pathetics)
Don't forget the happy thoughts
All you need is happy thoughts
The past tense, past bed time
Way back then when everything we read was real
And everything we said rhymed
Wide eyed kids being kids
When did you stop?
What did you do to your hair?
Where did you go to end up right back here?
When did you start to forget how to fly?
(This shit, wanna chew
Tastes like Juicy Fruit
Words have magnitude
Please get me out of that...)
Don't you color out
Don't you bleed out, oh
Stay in the line, stay in the line
Dandelion
(Do the same drugs no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more
We don't, we don't, we don't...)
Don't you color out
Don't you bleed out, oh
Stay in the line, stay in the line
Dandelion
Am I the only nigga still care about mixtapes
Am I the only nigga still care about mixtapes
I'm the only nigga still care about mixtapes
Bad little bitch, wanna know how lips taste
I swear I'm the only nigga still care about mixtapes
Bad little bitch, wanna know how the lips taste
All I can hear is the third, ayy
All I can hear is the third, ayy
We don't know none of your words, ayy
We don't know none of your words, ayy
I love my women real tall, ayy
Type that can really play ball, ayy
You buy my hat at the park, ayy
Think I might really play ball, ayy
I got a link in my bio my bitch do the salsa like pico de gallo
They gotta ask if they may, Cinco de Mayo
How can they call themselves bosses
When they got so many bosses
You gotta see what your boss say
I get it straight out the faucet
I ain't felt like this since the third drought, third carter drop
Told my momma third grade I'd be in the third Barbershop
And you know momma got real worried when she heard college drop
But now I call the shots

I'm the only nigga still care about mixtapes
Bad little bitch wanna know how lips taste
I swear I'm the only nigga still cares about mixtapes
Bad little bitch wanna know how lips taste
Angels, na, na, na, na

I got my city doing front flips
When every father, mayor, rapper jump ship
I guess that's why they call it where I stay
Clean up the streets, so my daughter can have somewhere to play
I'm the blueprint to a real man
Some of these niggas toss they tassel for a deal man
I ain't going to hell or the Hillman
Igh, Igh, Igh, Igh, for my real fans
I got caught up with a little Xan
Can't stop me but it slow me though
Yeah nigga famous, you don't know me though
But every DJ still play me though
Damn man, I don't even need a radio
And my new shit sound like a rodeo
Got the old folks dancing the Do-si-do
So they fuck around, sign me to OVO
Oooh, I just might share my next one with Keef
Got the industry in disbelief, they be asking for beef
This what it sound like when God split an atom with me
I even have Steve giving out apples for free
I ain't change my number since the seventh grade
This for my day one, ten years, seven days
A week, nigga's never tired on they Kevin Gates
And if they rest in peace they bunny hopping heaven's gates
It's too many young angels on the southside
Got us scared to let our grandmommas outside
You gonna make me take the campers way downtown
You gonna make me turn my BM to my housewife
I just had a growth spurt
It done took so long, my tippy toes hurt
You can keep the nose ring, I don't have to soul search
I'm still at my old church, only ever sold merch
Grandma say I'm Kosher, momma say I'm culture
GCI, 1-0-7-5, angel goin' live
Power 92, angel, juke, angel gon' juke
GCI, 1-0-7-5, goin' live
Power 92, angel gon' juke, juke, juke, juke
We used to roll at the rink
We used to roll at the rink
I used to talk way too much
You used to know everything
You couldn't stand me, I couldn't stand you
You said I'm steady playin', but you steady playin' too
Your big brother foot work
Your play sister Juke
The rink was the place but in that space and time I was too young for you
As you were for me, to worry 'bout Frooties and Trues
Till I found out all of the shawtys with cooties was cute
And realized what booties could do
We never rolled at the rink
We would just go to the rink
You ain't buy tokens no more
You just hip roll at the rink
You had a nigga, I couldn't stand him
But when they play "Take You Down", Chris Brown, I am his stand-in
I mean it's just dancing
It's harmless as fuck
Then I put my waist through your hips and your legs in my arms just to harness you up
Then we hit the floor
All the kiddies stopped skating
To see grown folks do, what grown folks do
When they grown and they dating
Everybody outside, everybody outside
When I pull up outside, all night, no
Everybody high five, everybody wanna smile
Everybody wanna lie, that's nice, no
Oh, now you wanna chill, oh, now you wanna build
Oh, now you got the bill, that's cool though
Oh, now you got the gas, oh, now you wanna laugh
Oh, now you need a cab, that's true though
All you do is talk, I ain't got shit to say
Can't no one get in my car, I don't even valet
Long discussions, oh, you my cousin?
No you wasn't, you just wanna ride
You just wanna talk about politics, Chicago shit and rocket ships
(You just wanna, you just wanna, you just wanna, you just wanna, you just wanna, you just wanna)
Shut up! Start dancing, ho
You just went and spilt fries in the seat
It's fried on the seat, come ride on the seat, ay
Last girl, she'll lie on the seat, she'll fart on the seat
Now she jog in the streets, say
I don't trust no one faking like a fan, asking for a pic
You should use your phone, call a Uber
You a goofy if you think I don't know you need a lyft
Is you is or is you ain't got gas money
No IOU's or debit cards, I need cash money
So back up, back up, I need space
Now, I need you to slow down, it's not a race
Now I can't really hear what you gotta say now
Shut up! Start dancing, ho
The first, is that God is better than the world's best thing
God is better than the best thing that the world has to offer
Magnify, magnify, lift it on high
Spit it Spotify to qualify a spot on his side
I cannot modify or ratify, my momma made me apple pies
Lullabies and alibis
The book don't end with Malachi
Devil will win employee of the month by the dozen
Till one score in three years from the third when he doesn't
My village raised 'em a child, come through the crib and it's bustin'
You meet anyone from my city, they gon' say that we cousins
Shabach barak, edify
Electrified the enemy like Hedwig till he petrefied
Any petty Peter Petigrew could get the pesticide
79th, 79th, I don't believe in science
I believe in signs
Don't believe in signing, I see dollar signs
Color white collar crime
Good God, the gift of freedom
Hosena Santa invoked and woke up slaves from south Hampton to Chatham Manor
My dream girl's is behind me, feel like I'm James Early
The type of worship make Jesus come back a day early
With the faith of a pumpkin-seed-sized mustard seed
Here, for I will speak noble things as they trusted me
Only righteous, I might just shrug at the skullduggery
I couldn't stand to see another rapper lose custody
Exalt, Exalt, glorify
Descend upon the earth with swords and fortify the borders where your shoulders lies
I used to hide from God
Ducked down in the slums like "shhh"
We just be smoking a bowl
We just be smoking
We just be smoking a bowl
We just be smoking a bowl
We just be
We just be smoking a bowl
We just be smoking a bowl
We just be smoking a, we just
Fuck is going on? When did we buy a bowl?
We just be smoking a bowl
We ain't got no time to roll
I'm always out on the road
She don't got time for a whole
Little bit of time that we have
We used to purchase a half
There don't be no time to smoke
I'm always throwing on clothes
She always throwing a fit
We don't got no time for no sex
I just put milk in the bowl
She don't be cooking at all
She just put weed in the bowl
She don't have time for herself
She putting points on the board, yes
You know she carry her own
You know she carry a child
She wake up at crack of dawn
She don't be cracking a smile
So when she packing the bowl
I grab her, I tell her...
Let me crack this blunt
Slow it down for a second
Break it down oh
She said, "let me lick this blunt"
Slow it down for a second
Break it down oh
We deserve, we deserve
We deserve, we deserve
A smoke break
We deserve, we deserve
We deserve, we deserve
A smoke break
Truth being told, we used to movies and bowl
We used to Netflix and roll
I used to pass her the smoke
She used to laugh at my jokes
You pat my back when I choke
Wish we were stuck in our ways
We way too young to get old
We stuck together like oowops
We smoked a fatty sing Zoo-Wap
Traphouse 3, Guwop
I shoulda knew when I grew up
It would be no time at all
We went from White Owls to Raws
We went from joints to a bowl
She need a second to breathe
We need an actual smoke sesh

Let me crack your back
Slow it down for a second
Take it down oh
Let me run this back
Slow it down for a minute
You deserve, you deserve
We deserve, we deserve
We deserve, we deserve
A smoke break
We deserve, we deserve
We deserve, we deserve
A smoke break

Let me crack your back
Let me rub you all over
Take it down oh
Let me make this blunt
Make you dinner or somethin'

You deserve, you deserve
We deserve, we deserve
We deserve, we deserve
A smoke break
We deserve, we deserve
We deserve, we deserve
A smoke break

They ain't teaching taxes in school
It don't even matter I was acting a fool
But who would think their raps would turn into racks?
Don't matter, matter fact, it could happen to you
Scars on my head I'm the boy who lived
The boy love playing when the boy too sick
Reclining on a prayer, I'm declining to help
I've been lying to my body can't rely on myself
Last year got addicted to xans
Suffocated my name and starting missing my chance
LA for four months end up leaving right back
I'm in love with my city bitch I sleep in my hat
I felt hog tied ever since my dog died
He lived to 84, damn, that's a long ride
I know he up there he just siting there waiting
I'll be racing up the stairs I'm a get to the gate singing


Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do

Gimme the water, gimme the water
I need the kind from Space Jam
Get this money, get this budget, KOK to day camp
Me and my girl plan to stay to the end
Hope there never come a day where we be better as friends
We in a marathon we could build a marriage on
Arguments as parents digging deeper than a baritone
I've been getting blocked just trying to make songs with friends
Labels told me to my face that they own my friends
I got to pray I got to pray, like Hammer after "2 Legit"
I got the power I could poke Lucifer with crucifix
I cannot scrap the stupid shit
I "Stand Up" like I'm Ludacris
I know some folks that talk so much they drive an Uber whip
Damn, queen said why we in a queen bed
I said its yours don't worry little bean head
I'm just here to catch my breath I got a world tattoo
She said cool just bring me some food
The water may be deeper than its ever been
Never drown
The water may be deeper than its ever been
Never drown
