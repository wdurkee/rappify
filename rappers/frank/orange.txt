They look like twins
That was embarrassing
A tornado flew around my room before you came
Excuse the mess it made, it usually doesn't rain
In Southern California, much like Arizona
My eyes don't shed tears, but, boy, they pour

When I'm thinkin' 'bout you (ooh, no, no, no)
I been thinkin' 'bout you (you know, know, know)
I been thinkin' 'bout you
Do you think about me still?
Do you, do you?

Or do you not think so far ahead (ahead)?
'Cause I've been thinkin' 'bout forever (Oooh, oooh)

Or do you not think so far ahead (ahead)?
'Cause I've been thinkin' 'bout forever (Oooh, oooh)

No, I don't like you, I just thought you were cool
Enough to kick it
Got a beach house I could sell you in Idaho
Since you think I don't love you, I just thought you were cute
That's why I kissed you
Got a fighter jet, I don't get to fly it, though

I'm lyin' down thinkin' 'bout you (ooh, no, no, no)
I've been thinkin' 'bout you (you know, know, know)
I've been thinkin' 'bout you
Do you think about me still?
Do you, do you?

Or do you not think so far ahead (ahead)?
'Cause I've been thinkin' 'bout forever (Oooh, oooh)

Or do you not think so far ahead (ahead)?
'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever (Oooh, oooh)

Yes, of course
I remember, how could I forget (how could I forget)?
How you feel (how you feel)?
You know you were my first time (time).
A new feel
It won't ever get old, not in my soul,
Not in my spirit, keep it alive (spirit, keep it alive)
We'll go down this road
'Til it turns from color to black and white

Or do you not think so far ahead (ahead)?
'Cause I've been thinkin' 'bout forever (Oooh, oooh)

Or do you not think so far ahead (ahead)?
'Cause I've been thinkin' 'bout forever (Oooh, oooh)
Fertilizer
I'll take bullshit if that's all you got
Some fertilizer
Fertilizer
(I was spendin' too much time alone)
Spendin' too much time alone...
(And I just ran outta Trojans)
Horses gallop to her throne
(We were behaving like teenagers)
We're behaving like teenagers
(Makin' less than minimum wage)
Still inside our parents' homes
(No I don't live in Denver)
No, I don't live in Denver
(I grew up in Sierra Leone)
And her pink skies will keep me warm
Sierra Leone
Sierra Leone
Tid bits of intuition that I been gettin' abandon admission (Sierra Leone)
Abandon mission, you must be kiddin', this shit feelin' different
Shit feelin' too good to me, glistening,
Shimmerin' underneath the sunlight, the sunlight (Sierra Leone)
And a new day will bring about the dawn
And a new day will bring another cryin' babe into the world (girl now)
Our daughter's reachin' for the nipple cause it's time for her to eat
Tonight I'll lay her in the cradle if it's time for go to sleep
I sing a Lennon lullaby, she can have a pretty dream
Baby girl if you knew what I know, knew what I know
Na, na na, na na, na...
Na, na na, na na, na...
The best song wasn't the single, but you weren't either
Livin' in Ladera Heights, the black Beverly Hills
Domesticated paradise, palm trees and pools
The water's blue, swallow the pill

Keepin' it surreal, whatever you like
Whatever feels good, whatever takes you mountain high
Keepin' it surreal, not sugar-free
My TV ain't HD, that's too real
Grapevine, mango, peaches and limes, the sweet life

Sweet life, sweet life
Sweet life, sweet life
The sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet life
Sweet life, the sweet life
Sweetie pie

You've had a landscaper and a house keeper since you were born
The sunshine always kept you warm
So why see the world, when you got the beach
Don't know why see the world, when you got the beach
The sweet life

The best song wasn't the single, but you couldn't turn your radio down
Satellite need a receiver, can't seem to turn the signal fully off
Transmitting the waves
You're catching that breeze 'til you're dead in the grave

But you're keepin' it surreal, whatever you like
Whatever feels good, whatever takes you mountain high
Keepin' it surreal, not sugar-free, my tv ain't HD, that's too real
Grapevines, mango, peaches and lime, a sweet life

A sweet life
A sweet life, yeah
A sweet life, a sweet life
A sweet life
Live and die in the life

You've had a landscaper and a house keeper since you were born, yeah
The sunshine always kept you warm
So why see the world, when you got the beach
Don't know why see the world, when you got the beach

And the water, is exactly what I wanted
It's everything I thought it would be (Thought it would be)
But this neighborhood is gettin' trippier every day
The neighborhood is goin' ape shit crazy

You've had a landscaper and a house keeper since you were born
The sunshine always kept you warm
So why see the world, when you got the beach
Don't know why see the world, when you got the beach
The sweet life
Stop thinking of this as being money
It's just money, I'ma make more
No, no no no no no
Please decondition yourself
It's not just money
It's happiness
It's the difference between happy, being happy and sad
It's the difference between having a home and living on the streets
That's what it is, it's not just money
It's so much more than that
Right now it's the difference between you being able to go to a prom
And disappointing a girl
As I told you from the beginning, I don't have money
I have bills to pay, but that meant nothing to you
Absolutely nothing
Let's see, I have
Ooh yeah, I'ma make myself a hot link when I get home
It meant nothing to you
Savin' my seven dollars
Too many bottles of this wine we can't pronounce
Too many bowls of that green, no lucky charms
The maids come around too much
Parents ain't around enough
Too many joy rides in daddy's jaguar
Too many white lies and white lines
Super rich kids with nothing but loose ends
Super rich kids with nothing but fake friends
Start my day up on the roof
There's nothing like this type of view
Point the clicker at the tube
I prefer expensive news
New car, new girl
New ice, new glass
New watch, good times babe
It's good times, yeah
She wash my back three times a day
This shower head feels so amazing
We'll both be high, the help don't stare
They just walk by, they must don't care
A million one, a million two
A hundred more will never do
Too many bottles of this wine we can't pronounce
Too many bowls of that green, no lucky charms
The maids come around too much
Parents ain't around enough
Too many joy rides in daddy's jaguar
Too many white lies and white lines
Super rich kids with nothing but loose ends
Super rich kids with nothing but fake friends
Real love, I'm searching for a real love
Oh, real love, I'm searching for a real love
Oh, real love
We end our day up on the roof
I say I'll jump, I never do
But when I'm drunk I act a fool
Talking 'bout, do they sew wings on tailored suits
I'm on that ledge, she grabs my arm
She slaps my head
It's good times, yeah
Sleeve rips off, I slip, I fall
The market's down like 60 stories
And some don't end the way they should
My silver spoon has fed me good
A million one, a million cash
Close my eyes and feel the crash
Real love (ain't that something rare)
I'm searching for a real love (talking 'bout real love)
Real love, yea
Real love (real love)
I'm searching for a real love
Talking 'bout a real love
Too many bottles of this wine we can't pronounce
Too many bowls of that green, no lucky charms
The maids come around too much
Parents ain't around enough
Too many joy rides in daddy's jaguar
Too many white lies and white lines
Super rich kids with nothing but loose ends
Super rich kids with nothing but fake friends
We once had things in common
Now the only thing we share is the refrigerator
Ice cold, baby, I told you, I'm ice cold (ice cold!)
You out here flyin' high (high!)
Go ahead, fly that thing!
High! High!
But fly alone


You always smokin' in the house
What if my mother comes over?
You can't get up and get a job
Cause this little hustle's getting you by
You're the dealer and the stoner with the sweetest kiss around

I know what I was on, I had a Pilot Jones
She took me high, then she took me home
Pilot Jones, Pilot Jones


Tonight she came stumblin' across my lawn again
I just don't know why I keep on tryin' to keep a grown woman sober
See there you go reachin' up your blouse and no I don't want a child
But I ain't been touched in a while by the dealer
And the stoner with the sweetest kiss I've ever known

I know what I was on, I had a Pilot Jones
She took me high, then she took me home
Pilot Jones, Pilot Jones


In the sky up above, the birds
I saw the sky like I never seen before
You thought I was above you
Above this in so many ways
But if I got a condo on a cloud
Then I guess you can stay at my place
I'ma get one
I need ya
Admit it
You're my Pilot Jones
You don't know how little you matter
Until you're all alone
In the middle of Arkansas
With a little rock left in that glass dick
Used to date a blonde
You used to hit it raw
Cause she was and you are madly involved
Madly involved

Hittin' stones in glass homes
You're smokin' stones in abandoned homes
You hit them stones and broke your home
Crack rock crack rock
Crack rock crack rock
Hittin' stones in glass homes
You're smokin' stones in abandoned homes
You're hittin' stones and broke your home
Crack rock crack rock
Crack rock crack rock

You're shuckin' and jivin', stealin' and robbin'
To get the fixing that you're itching for
Your family stopped inviting you to things
Won't let you hold their infant
You used to get a little cut-up from time to time
But the freaks ain't trying to sleep with cracky

Hittin' stones in glass homes
You're smokin' stones in abandoned homes
You hit them stones and you broke your home
Crack rock crack rock crack rock

Crooked cop dead cop
How much dope can you push to me
Crooked cop dead cop
No good for community
Fuckin' pig get shot
300 men will search for me
My brother get popped
And don't no one hear the sound
Don't no one hear the rounds, ooh, sound
Don't no one hear the shells, ooh, shells
Don't no one hear a sound
Don't no one disturb the peace for riot
Don't no one disrupt nirvana
Don't no one wanna blow the high
Crack rock, ooh
Crack rock, ooh
Crack rock
How you feeling girl
How's the gutter doing
Crack rock
Set the cheetahs on the loose
There's a thief out on the move
Underneath our legion's view
They have taken Cleopatra

Run run run come back for my glory
(Cleopatra, Cleopatra)

Bring her back to me
(Cleopatra, hey oh Patra ehh ehh Cleopatra)

Run run run the crown of our pharaoh
(Cleopatra, Cleopatra)

The throne of our queen is empty
(Hey oh' Patra, Cleopatra)

And we'll run to the future
Shining like diamonds in a rocky world
A rocky, rocky world
Our skin like bronze and our hair like cashmere
As we march to the rhythm
On the palace floor
Chandeliers inside the pyramids
Tremble from the force
Cymbals crash inside the pyramids
Voices fill up the halls

Set the cheetahs on the loose
There's a thief out on the move
Underneath our legion's view
They have taken Cleopatra, Cleopatra

The jewel of Africa
(Jewel)
What good is a jewel that ain't still precious
How could you run off on me?
How could you run off on us?
You feel like God inside that gold
I found you laying down with Samson
And his full head of hair
Found my black queen Cleopatra
Bad dreams Cleopatra

Remove her
Send the cheetahs to the tomb
Our war is over, our queen has met her doom
No more she lives, no more serpent in her room
No more, it has killed Cleopatra, Cleopatra

Big sun coming strong through the motel blinds
Wake up to your girl for now let's call her Cleopatra, Cleopatra
I watch you fix your hair
Then put your panties on in the mirror, Cleopatra
Then your lipstick, Cleopatra
Then your six inch heels
Catch her
She's headed to the pyramid

She's working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight

Pimping in my convos
Bubbles in my champagne
Let it be some jazz playing
Top floor motel suite, twisting my cigars
Floor model TV with the VCR
Got rubies in my damn chain
Whip ain't got no gas tank
But it still got woodgrain
Got your girl working for me
Hit the strip and my bills paid
That keep my bills paid
Hit the strip and my bills paid
Keep a nigga bills paid

She's working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid

You showed up after work I'm bathing your body
Touch you in places only I know
You're wet and you're warm just like our bathwater
Can we make love before you go
The way you say my name makes me feel like
I'm that nigga
But I'm still unemployed
You say it's big but you take it
Ride cowgirl
But your love ain't free no more, baby
But your love ain't free no more

She's working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
That's right
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Double D
Big full breasts on my baby (Yo we goin' to Florida)
Triple weight
Couldn't weight the love I've got for the girl
And I just wanna know
Why you ain't been goin' to work
Boss ain't workin' you like this
He can't take care of you like this


Now you're lost
Lost in the heat of it all
Girl you know you're lost
Lost in the thrill of it all
Miami, Amsterdam
Tokyo, Spain, lost
Los Angeles, India
Lost on a train, lost


Got on my buttercream silk shirt and it's Versace
Hand me my triple weight
So I can weight the work I got on your girl (Too weird to live, too weird to die)
No I don't really wish
I don't wish the titties would show
No, have I ever
Have I ever let you get caught?

Now you're lost
Lost in the heat of it all
Girl you know you're lost
Lost in the thrill of it all
Miami, Amsterdam
Tokyo, Spain, lost
Los Angeles, India
Lost on a train, lost


She's at a stove (Who?)
Can't believe I got her out here cookin' dope (Cookin' dope)
I promise she'll be
Whippin' meals up for a family of her own some day
Nothin' wrong (Nothin' wrong, ain't nothin' wrong)
No nothin' wrong with a lie
Nothin' wrong with another short plane ride
(Nothin' wrong, ain't nothin' wrong)
Through the sky (Up in the sky)
You and I (Just you and I)

Now you're lost
Lost in the heat of it all
Girl you know you're lost
Lost in the thrill of it all
Miami, Amsterdam
Tokyo, Spain, lost
Los Angeles, India
Lost on a train, lost


Love lost?
Love love
Love lost?
Love love
Love lost
Love love
Love lost

Faith is the substance
Then the other channel on the...
Could this be earth, could this be light
Does this mean everythings going to be alright
One look out my window there's trees talking like people

I dreamt of storms, I dreamt of sound
I dreamt of gravity keeping us around
I slept in the darkness it was lonely and it was silent

What is this love, I don't feel the same
Don't believe what this is, could be given a name
I awoke you there chasing planets on my forehead

But I forget 23 like I forget 17
And I forget my first love, like you forget a day dream
And what of all my wild friends, and the times I've had with them
But I'll fade to grey soon on the tv station

Mosh pits and bare chest
Stage diving sky diver
Spray the crowd with cold water
Now it's mosh pits and wet tits
I think I need a cold shower
Cool waters
African girl speaks in English accent
Likes to fuck boys in bands
Likes to watch westerns
And ride me without the hands
Show me her passport
She's on her own tour
But you're beautiful to me
Wave 'em high girl to the sky
But you're beautiful to me
(We're in the clouds)
Wave 'em high girl to the sky
But you're beautiful to me
(Life in the clouds)
Keep em high y'all
(Beautiful stars)
In the sky

Monks in the mosh pit
Stage diving Dalai Lama
Feet covered in cut flowers
They mosh for enlightenment
Clean chakra, good karma
One with the water
Indian girl sleeps above the temple
Planning a run away young at heart
You found a boyfriend
And now you wanna get away, get away
Just a virgin lover on a getaway, getaway
And at sunset they're gonna try and get away, get away
Abhaya Mudra

I never ask for much
But please keep up lover
We've got no choices left
The running's fast
Run run run run
You're beautiful to me
Run run run run, you'd better run
You mean so much to me

In my world
We made it safely
Even with your father's army trailing us
We escaped him
Even with his archer's bows at our backs
What a great escape
But there's a long way still in fact
We're lost in a jungle underneath these clouds
There's a monsoon that never ends
A coke white tiger woke us from our slumber
To guide and protect us til the end

We're in the clouds
Wave 'em high now to the sky
But you're beautiful to me
Keep 'em high y'all, show you right
But you're beautiful to me
Beautiful


Taxi driver
Be my shrink for the hour
Leave the meter running
It's rush hour
So take the streets if you wanna
Just outrun the demons, could you?
He said "allahu akbar", I told him don't curse me
"But boy you need prayer", I guess it couldn't hurt me
If it brings me to my knees
It's a bad religion


This unrequited love
To me it's nothing but
A one-man cult
And cyanide in my styrofoam cup
I could never make him love me
Never make him love me
Love, love...


Taxi driver
I swear I've got three lives
Balanced on my head like steak knives
I can't tell you the truth about my disguise
I can't trust no one
And you say "allahu akbar", I told him don't curse me
"But boy you need prayer", I guess it couldn't hurt me
If it brings me to my knees
It's a bad religion

This unrequited love
To me it's nothing but
A one-man cult
And cyanide in my styrofoam cup
I could never make him love me
Never make him love me
No, no

It's a bad religion
To be in love with someone
Who could never love you
Only bad
Only bad religion
Could have me feeling the way I do

And the peaches and the mangos
That you could sell for me...
What do you think my brain is made for
Is it just a container for the mind
This great grey matter
Sensei replied, what is your woman
Is she just a container for the child
That soft pink matter
Cotton candy Majin Buu
Close my eyes and fall into you
My God she's giving me pleasure

What if the sky and the stars are for show
And the aliens are watching live
From the purple matter
Sensei went quiet then violent
And we sparred until we both grew tired
Nothing mattered
Cotton candy Majin Buu
Dim the lights and fall into you, you, you
My God, giving me pleasure
Pleasure, pleasure, pleasure
Pleasure over matter

I wanna see your pom poms from the stands
Come on, come on

My fingertips, and my lips, they burn
From the cigarettes
Forrest Gump, you run my mind boy
Running on my mind boy
Forrest Gump

I know you Forrest
I know you wouldn't hurt a beetle
But you're so buff, and so strong
I'm nervous Forrest

Forrest Gump
My fingertips, and my lips, they burn
From the cigarettes
Forrest Gump you run my mind boy
Running on my mind boy
Forrest Gump

I saw ya game, Forrest
I was screamin' run 44
But you kept runnin' past the end zone
Oh where'd you go Forrest

Forrest Gump
My fingertips, and my lips, they burn
From the cigarettes
Forrest Gump you run my mind boy
Running on my mind boy
Forrest Gump

Forrest green
Forrest blues
I re-mem-ber you
If this is love, I know it's true
I won't for-get you (you)
(You you, oh you you) It's for you Forrest
(You you, oh you you) It's for you Forrest
Forrest Gump
Darker times
They're telling boulder heavy lies
Looks like all we've got is each other
The truth is obsolete
Remember when all I had was my mother
She didn't compromise
She could recognize
Voodoo
Our daughters and our sons
Are just candles in the sun
Voodoo
Don't let him see divide
Don't you let her see divide
Voodoo
She's got the whole wide world in her juicy fruit
He's got the whole wide world in his pants
He wrapped the whole wide world in a wedding band
Then put the whole wide world on her hands
She's got the whole wide world in her hands
He's got the whole wide world in his hands

There's somethin' about you
I can't believe I'm even talking to you, tellin' me this right now
You're special
I wish you could see what I see
