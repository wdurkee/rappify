Why would she make calls out the blue
Now I'm awake, sleepless til noon

Hey hey hey hey
Don't say you will
Unless you will
Hey hey hey hey
Don't say you will
Then play you will
I pray you will

Mrs. So-Fly crash-lands in my room
Can't waste no time, she might leave soon

Hey hey hey hey
Don't say you will
You will
Hey hey hey hey
Don't say you will
One day you will
I pray you will

When I grab your neck, I touch your soul
Take off your cool then lose control

Hey hey hey hey
Don't say you will
You will you will
Hey hey hey hey
Don't say you will
If you will
I pray you will

I wish this song would really come true
I admit I still fantasize about you
About you

Hey hey hey hey
Don't say you will
You will you will
Hey hey hey hey
Please say you will
For real
I pray you will
My friend showed me pictures of his kids
And all I could show him was pictures of my cribs
He said his daughter got a brand new report card (card)
And all I got was a brand new sports car
Uh
And my head keeps spinning
Can't stop having these visions
I gotta get wit' it
Oh ho, oh ho, oh ho
And my head keeps spinning
I can't stop having these visions
I gotta get wit' it
Oh ho, oh ho, oh ho
Dad cracked a joke all the kids laugh
But I couldn't hear em all the way in first class
Chased the good life my whole life long
Look back on my life and my life gone
Where did I go wrong?
My god sister gettin' married by the lake
But I couldn't figure out who I want to take
Bad enough that I showed up late
I had to leave 'fore they even cut the cake
Welcome to Heartbreak
I seen it, I seen it before
I seen it, I seen it before
I've seen it, I've seen it before
I seen it, I seen it before
Oh ho
Oh ho
Oh ho

And I can't, and I can't stop
No, no I can't stop
No, no, no, no I can't stop
No, no, no, no I can't stop
Can't stop, I can't stop, I can't stop
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no
No, no I can't stop

Can't stop having these visions
I gotta get wit it
Oh ho, oh ho, oh ho
Oh ho
Oh... oh ho
In the night, I hear them talk the coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road, he lost his soul
To a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless
Oh, how could you be so heartless?

How could you be so cold
As the winter wind when it breeze yo
Just remember that you talking to me though
You need to watch the way you talking to me yo
I mean after all the things that we been through
I mean after all the things we got into
Ayo, I know there are some things that you ain't told me
Ayo, I did some things but that's the old me
And now you wanna get me back and you gonna show me
So you walk around like you don't know me
You got a new friend, well, I got homies
But in the end it's still so lonely

In the night, I hear them talk the coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road,
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless
Oh, how could you be so heartless?

How could you be so Dr. Evil?
You bringing out a side of me that I don't know
I decided we weren't gonna speak so
Why we up 3 A.M. on the phone?
Why would she be so mad at me for?
Homie, I don't know she's hot and cold
I won't stop won't mess my groove up
Cause I already know how this thing go
You run and tell your friends that you're leaving me
They say that they don't see what you see in me
You wait a couple months then you gonna see
You'll never find nobody better than me

In the night, I hear them talk the coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless
Oh, how could you be so heartless?

Talking talking talking talk
Baby, let's just knock it off
They don't know what we been through
They don't know about me and you
So why I got something new to see?
And you just gon' keep hating me
And we just gon' be enemies

I know you can't believe
I could just leave it wrong
And you can't make it right
I'm gon' take off tonight
Into the night

In the night, I hear them talk the coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless
Oh, how could you be so heartless?
It's amazing, I'm the reason
Everybody fired up this evening
I'm exhausted, barely breathing
Holding on to what I believe in
No matter what, you'll never take that from me
My reign is as far as your eyes can see
It's amazing, so amazing, so amazing, so amazing
It's amazing
I'm a monster, I'm a killer
I know I'm wrong
I'm a problem
That'll never ever be solved
And no matter what, you'll never take that from me
My reign is as far as your eyes can see
It's amazing, so amazing, so amazing, so amazing
It's amazing
I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to
What I had to do, had to run from you
I'm in love with you but the vibe is wrong
And that haunted me, all the way home
So you never know, never never know,
Never know enough, 'til it's over love
'Til we lose control, system overload
Screamin' "No! No! No! N-No!"
I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to
See I wanna move, but can't escape from you
So I keep it low, keep a secret code
So everybody else don't have to know
So keep your love locked down
Your love locked down
Keepin' your love locked down
Your love locked down
Now keep your love locked down
Your love locked down
Now keep your love locked down
You lose
I'm not lovin' you the way I wanted to
I can't keep my cool, so I keep it true
I got somethin to lose, so I gotta move
I can't keep myself, and still keep you too
So I keep in mind, when I'm on my own
Somewhere far from home, in the danger zone
How many times did I tell ya fo it finally got through
You lose, you lose
I'm not lovin' you, the way I wanted to
See I had to go, see I had to move
No more wastin' time, you can't wait for life
We're just wastin' time, where's the finish line
So keep your love locked down
Your love locked down
Keepin' your love locked down
Your love locked down
Now keep your love locked down
Your love locked down
Now keep your love locked down
You lose
I'm not lovin you, the way I wanted to
I bet no one knew, I got no one new
I know I said I'm through, but got love for you
But I'm not lovin' you, the way I wanted to
Gotta keep it goin', keep the lovin' goin'
Keep it on a roll, only God knows
If I be with you, baby I'm confused
You choose, you choose
I'm not lovin' you, the way I wanted to
Where I wanna go, I don't need you
I've been down this road, too many times before
I'm not lovin' you, the way I wanted to
So keep your love locked down
Your love locked down
Keepin' your love locked down
Your love locked down
Now keep your love locked down
Your love locked down
Now keep your love locked down
You lose, you lose
You lose, you lose
You lose
Why are you so paranoid
Don't be so paranoid
Don't be so....

You worry bout the wrong things, the wrong things

You really wanna spend your whole life alone
A little time out might do you good, might do us good
Before we be done for good
Cause I make it good I could make it hood
I can make you come I can make you go

Show some gratitude leave the attitude way back at home
Yea you see em look
Baby let em look give us cold looks cause we look cold
Yea you heard about all the word of mouth

All the talk in the world lost in the world

They'll never know you
Anyway they don't know you like I do

[Verse 1]
Bout the baddest girl I ever seen
Straight up out a movie scene
Who knew she was a drama queen
That a turn my life to Stephen King
Up late night like she on patrol
Checking everything like I'm on parole
I told her some things she don't need to know
She never let it go
Ok, Ok, Ok, Ok
You will never stop it now
You never stop it now
Ok, Ok, Ok
You will never stop it now
You need to drop it now....drop it...drop it
Cause I don't want no Robocop
You moving like a Robocop
When did you become a Robocop
Now I don't need no Robocop
Just looking at your history
You like the girl from Misery
She said she ain't take it to this degree
Well let's agree to disagree
Shorty kind of crazy but it turn me on
Keep it up enough to keep it goin? on
I told her some things she don't need to know
She never let it go
Ok, ok, ok, ok
You will never stop it now
You never stop it now
Ok, ok, ok, ok
You will never stop it now
You need to drop it now....drop it...drop it
Stop...drop...roll...pop bitch I'm cold....I
Ain't used to being told stop
So I could never be your robot
Fast or slow you can stay or can go
Now, now that you know, now, now that you know
Yea I had her before but that happened before
You get mad when you know so just don't ask me no more
Ok, ok, ok, uh, uh
It ain't ok, ok, ok

Her love is a thousand miles away

Memories made in the coldest winter
Goodbye my friend will I ever love again

Her love is all that I can see

Memories made in the coldest winter
Goodbye my friend will I ever love again

Winter, winter

Goodbye my friend will I ever love again
